What
------

* done last time:
    * earth following orbit âœ“
    * earth orbiting sun speed != sun rotation speed by using time*= value in render function
    * add Moon (check out tutorial below)
    * finish scenegraph tutorial https://r105.threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-scenegraph.html ) 

* last update: tried to add Orbits but the rings are not drawn
* next:
    * textures  https://r105.threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-textures.html
        could not figure out how to load textures. When I add it via TextureLoader() it throws 404 and if I add via import ... with a file-loader configured in webpack it gives issues in typescript that such module is not defined or whatever

* ideas:
    * sun glowing              /
    * typical sun light rays  O
                             /
    * shader/bump map to create sun like surface
